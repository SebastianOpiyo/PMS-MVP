## Workflow

This product is built using the following widely used technologies:

- React.js front-end library
- Bootstrap 5 CSS Framework
- Sass preprocessing language
- NPM & Yarn



## Quick start
### Using Docker
1. Make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
2. After successful installation run the following commands to build the image and run them from the base directory:
  ```
  sudo docker build -t <sudoimage-name of choice> .
  ```
  ```
  sudo docker run <sudoimage-name>
  ```
3. On successful running,copy the link generated and paste it on your browser to view the app status and test it.

### Using Yarn

1. Make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.
2. After installing `yarn`, open a terminal and run `yarn install` in the main volt folder to download all project dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

3. Then start the app in development mode by running the following command in terminal:

```
yarn start
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

5. If you want to generate the production files, change the `homepage` value from the `package.json` to the domain name that the app will be hosted on, and then run the following command in the terminal:

```
yarn build
```

### Using NPM

```

3. Then start the app in development mode by running the following command in terminal:

```
npm run start
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.
